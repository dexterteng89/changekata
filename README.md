<h1> Change - Kata </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

This program is designed to take an amount of money and break it up into the most efficient way to give back purely change in coins. 

If we have $2.76 it will output an array of:

[25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 1]

Assuming we are only working with quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

<h2> Example </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>class Change</p>
<p>  make_change_for(dollar_amt)</p>
<p>end</p>
</blockquote>
